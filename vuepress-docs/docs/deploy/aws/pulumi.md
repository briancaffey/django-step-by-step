::: tip
For the most up-to-date information on `pulumi-aws-django`, please see the repository's [open issues](https://github.com/briancaffey/pulumi-aws-django/issues) and [Changelog](https://github.com/briancaffey/pulumi-aws-django/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
:::

- `pulumi-aws-django` code share similarities with both `cdk-django` and `terraform-aws-django`
- `pulumi-aws-django` is most similar to `terraform-aws-django` since the Pulumi AWS Provider is derived from the code used in the Terraform AWS Provider
