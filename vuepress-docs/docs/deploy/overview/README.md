# Overview of options for deploying Î¼blog

This project focuses on deploying to AWS using ECS Fargate. GitHub Actions are used for deployment pipelines.

There are three options for Infrastructure as Code:

- [`terraform-aws-django`](https://github.com/briancaffey/terraform-aws-django)
- [`cdk-django`](https://github.com/briancaffey/cdk-django)
- [`pulumi-aws-django`](https://github.com/briancaffey/pulumi-aws-django)

Each of these options has corresponding GitHub Actions workflow files.

[See this article for an in-depth overview of these different deployment options](https://briancaffey.github.io/2023/01/07/i-deployed-the-same-containerized-serverless-django-app-with-aws-cdk-terraform-and-pulumi)
