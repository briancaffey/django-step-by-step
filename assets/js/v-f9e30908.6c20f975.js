This project has been tested and developed on:</p><ul><li>Ubuntu 20.04</li><li>macOS 11.4 (Apple Silicon)</li><li>Windows 10 (WSL + Docker Desktop)</li></ul><p>Windows 10 PowerShell development environment is still WIP. Here are some important features of the local development environment:</p><h3 id="makefile" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#makefile" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Makefile</h3><p>A Makefile is included in the root of the project to document.

Poetry dependencies and dev-dependencies are specified in <code>pyproject.toml</code>. These dependencies are exported to two files:</p><ul><li><code>requirements.txt</code>: This contains only the dependencies that are required by the project for running in production</li><li><code>requirements_dev.txt</code>: This contains all the dependencies that are required for running in production and for local development</li></ul><h3 id="developing-with-virtual-environments" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#developing-with-virtual-environments" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Developing with virtual environments</h3><p>The application can be developed with a virtual environment locally. This requires starting postgres and redis services locally. Alternatively, postgres, redis and other supporting services can be started with a docker-compose file that exposes the services on <code>localhost</code>.</p><h3 id="developing-with-docker" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#developing-with-docker" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Developing with docker</h3><p>Docker is a popular choice for developing and deploying applications, including Django. docker-compose can be used to run the application and dependent services in containers. See <code>docker-compose.yml</code> in the root directory for more details.</p><p>The docker-compose file contains the following services:</p><ul><li>postgres: Postgres service</li><li>redis: Redis service</li><li>pgadmin: Postgres admin service</li><li>redis-commander: Redis admin service</li><li>backend: main Django web application</li><li>celery_default: celery worker that processes the default queue</li><li>beat: celery process that queues tasks on a schedule</li><li>mailhog: a local SMTP server for testing</li></ul><p>The application can also run locally inside a local Kubernetes cluster. This is made possible with minikube. cdk8s and pulumi are both used to show how kubernetes manifest files can be generated dynamically from code (TypeScript) and deployed to a cluster.</p><h3 id="e2e-testing-with-cypress" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#e2e-testing-with-cypress" aria-hidden="true">#</a> e2e testing with Cypress</h3><p>Cypress is used for e2e testing which can run locally against the docker-compose development environment. To test user registration and email verification in e2e tests, MailHog and the MailHog API are used to retrieve the email confirmation link from the email sent by the Django application.</p><h2 id="continuous-intergration" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#continuous-intergration" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Continuous Intergration</h2><p>Multiple tools are used for running unit tests and code quality checks on each commit. These include:</p><ul><li>GitHub Actions</li><li>GitLab CI</li><li>Bitbucket Pipelines</li></ul><p>Continuous integration checks that all unit tests pass and that code is formatted correctly. Unit tests run the Python code in a simulated environment that contains the dependent services (postgres and redis).
